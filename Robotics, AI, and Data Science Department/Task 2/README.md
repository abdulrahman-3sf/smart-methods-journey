# Task 2: Real-Time Face Detection
## Smart Methods Journey - Robotics, AI, and Data Science Department

### What is this task?
This project builds a real-time face detection system that automatically opens your **camera** and draws a rectangle around your face when you put it in front of the camera.

### How it works
1. Run the code - camera opens automatically
2. Put your face in front of the camera
3. The system detects your face
4. It draws a rectangle around your face
5. Updates in real-time as you move

### Files in this project
- `face_detection.py` - Main script that opens camera automatically
- `[second_file]` - [Second file in the repository]

### How to use it
1. Install required library:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
2. Simply run the code:
   ```
   python face_detection.py
   ```
3. **That's it!** The camera will open automatically
4. Put your face in front of the camera
5. See a rectangle drawn around your face in real-time

### What happens
- Camera window opens automatically
- When you put your face in front of the camera, a rectangle appears around it
- The rectangle follows your face as you move
- Real-time face detection and tracking

### What I learned
- Real-time computer vision with OpenCV
- Face detection algorithms using Haar cascades
