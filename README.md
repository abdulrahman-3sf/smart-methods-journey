# 🤖 Smart Methods Internship Journey

Welcome to my internship documentation at [Smart Methods](https://www.s-m.com.sa), where I had the opportunity to work across four key departments: Mechanical, Electronics & IoT, Robotics & AI, and Software. This repository showcases the tasks I completed, the skills I learned, and the real-world systems I contributed to.
