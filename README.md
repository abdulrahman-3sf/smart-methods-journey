# 🤖 Smart Methods Internship Journey

Welcome to my internship documentation at [Smart Methods](https://www.s-m.com.sa), where I had the opportunity to work across four key departments: Mechanical, Electronics & IoT, Robotics & AI, and Software. This repository showcases the tasks I completed, the skills I learned, and the real-world systems I contributed to.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project is divided into four main folders, each representing a department. Inside each folder, you’ll find subfolders labeled as `Task 1`, `Task 2`, etc., corresponding to each assigned task.

- **Mechanical Department**

- **Electronics and IoT Department**

- **Robotics, AI and Data Science Department**

- **Web/Application Development**
