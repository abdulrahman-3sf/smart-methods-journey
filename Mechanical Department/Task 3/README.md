# Task 3: Joint Part Design
## Smart Methods Journey – Mechanical Department

### What is this task?
This task is about creating a **mechanical part** for a robot. The part sits inside the **robot's joint** and helps the joint move in **one direction only (1D movement)**.

### How it works
- The part controls the movement of the joint in **one axis**.
- It is designed to **fit perfectly** in the joint space.
- The part supports the robot’s motion while keeping it stable.

### What was done
- I used **OnShape** to draw the part.
- The part file is named: `joint.sldprt`

### Files
- `joint.sldprt` → The 3D model of the joint part

### What I learned
- How to design a mechanical part in **OnShape**
- How robot joints work and how to make a part for **1D movement**
- How to save and name SolidWorks part files properly
