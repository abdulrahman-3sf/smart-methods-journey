# Task 2: Food Warehouse Robot

## Smart Methods Journey - Mechanical Engineering Department

### What is this task?
This task focuses on designing a **robotic system for food warehouse automation**. The robot picks food packages from a **red storage rack** (where staff place items) and places them onto an **escalator-style conveyor** for delivery or sorting.

### How it works
1. **Red Rack**: Staff place food items here  
2. **Blue Robot Arm**: Moves along the track to pick items  
3. **Placement**: Items are transferred to the black roller conveyor  
4. **Automation**: Streamlines food handling and reduces manual work  

### What makes it special
- Designed for **warehouse environments**  
- **Automates pickup and placement** tasks  
- **Compact and efficient** layout  
- Supports faster logistics and food flow  

### Files in this project
