# Task 1: 5-DOF Robotic Arm Design

## Smart Methods Journey - Mechanical Engineering Department

### What is this task?
This project involves designing a **5-DOF (5 Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm** using 3D modeling software. The robot can move and rotate in 5 different ways, making it capable of reaching various positions and orientations in 3D space.

### How it works
1. **5 Joints**: Each joint provides one degree of freedom
2. **Base Rotation**: Robot can rotate around its base (Joint 1)
3. **Shoulder Movement**: Arm can move up and down (Joint 2)
4. **Elbow Movement**: Forearm can bend (Joint 3)
5. **Wrist Rotation**: End-effector can rotate (Joint 4)
6. **Gripper Action**: End-effector can open/close (Joint 5)
7. **Multiple Positions**: Robot can reach different points in workspace

### What makes it special
- **5 Degrees of Freedom**: More flexible than basic 3-DOF robots
- **Industrial Design**: Suitable for pick-and-place operations
- **Workspace Analysis**: Can reach multiple positions and orientations

### Files in this project
- Multiple 3D robot images showing different configurations

### Robot specifications
- **Type**: Serial manipulator with 5 joints
- **Joints**: 5 revolute joints
- **Workspace**: 3D reachable area around the base
- **End-effector**: Gripper or tool attachment point
- **Movement**: Smooth transitions between positions

### What I learned
- 3D robot modeling and design principles
- Understanding degrees of freedom in robotics
- Mechanical design for robotic systems
